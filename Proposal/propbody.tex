\section*{Introduction and Description of the Work}

The aim of this project is to extract a 3D model of a small object from a sequence of plain images and then to export the model into a 3D geometry format such as PLY. The resulting file can then be rendered and processed by MeshLab (or similar).  \\
The main focus of the project is to obtain a wireframe model, leaving shading and texture mapping as a possible extension. \\
The inputted set of pictures must be obtained using the following technique [add an image to represent this]: 
{\emph Define an "origin" on a perfectly horizontal table and place the camera there facing a white background. Place an object of max height X at a distance Y from the origin. Take the first picture. Rotate the object 30 degrees (counter clockwise as seen from camera) and take the second picture ... until 12 pictures are taken. Some other details to work out such as focal distance, skew coefficients, principal point, distortions. Update pictures in the order in which they were taken. Assume well-lit room and no major light differences between pictures in the same set.} \\
Extension: implement self-calibration such that in theory the project will work on any set of pictures as long as large overlap and completely determines the object.

\section*{Starting Point}
Some experience with C/C++.
IB maths and graphics.

\section*{Resources Required}
Camera(add detailed description - probably anything with manual settings will do), my own computer + backup plans.
Open source libraries I might use: openCV, openGL (for test harness), MeshLab (to view the output), a camera calibration tool (such as for the extension).

\section*{Work to be done}
For core bits (strictly sufficient to satisfy the success criterion):
\begin{itemize}
\item write test harness (to create digital snapshots of a polyhedron and test the 3D models on calibrated, error-free input) - this module will be later used to evaluate the results by adding a measured error to the inputs and comparing the outputs
\item detect edges in the 12 pictures
\item compute a dense set of correspondences between neighbouring images
{\emph stereo rectification, stereo matching, dense depth map}
\item reconstructing the 3D object shape
{\emph overlying a 2D triangular mesh on top of one of the images to bild corresponding 3D mesh by wrapping vertices of the triangles in 3D space by using depth maps OR volumetric depth map integration, Kalman filters}
\end{itemize}
Extensions:
\begin{itemize}
\item self-calibration: computing the geometric relation between neighbouring images, estimating the motion and calibration of the camera
\item {\emph search for texture mapping techniques}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Success Criterion}
 A system that can successfully construct the wireframe of a fairly regular object of maximum height X [more specific?] from pictures taken as described in introduction. \\ 
 {\emph The input images used to determine the success of the project will be considered to be error-free so probably computer-generated.} \\
 
 Might be helpful to compare results to those generated by ARC3D.
 
\section*{Possible Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item self-calibration
\item add shadowing to model
\item add texture to model
\end{itemize}
